# Foundations Calculator

A **calculator project** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
as part of **The Odin Project – Foundations Path**.

This project demonstrates building a functional calculator interface with basic arithmetic operations, a responsive design, and clean, interactive UI.

## 📋 Project Overview

The calculator supports:

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division  
- Special buttons: clear, negate, decimal, backspace  
- Interactive button feedback and styling  
- Real-time input display

The project focuses on DOM manipulation, event handling, and JavaScript logic implementation.

## ✨ Features

- Functional calculator with all standard operations  
- Interactive buttons with hover and active states  
- Input validation to prevent invalid operations (e.g., division by zero)  
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile  
- Simple, clean interface using CSS variables for consistent styling

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Semantic markup for calculator structure  
- **CSS3:** Styling, responsive layout, variables, and hover effects  
- **JavaScript (ES6):** DOM manipulation, event listeners, and calculation logic

## 📖 How It Works

* Each button triggers an event listener in `script.js`
* Number buttons append digits to the input display
* Operator buttons handle calculations and store operands
* Special buttons handle clear, negate, decimal, and backspace
* The script ensures valid operations and updates the display in real-time

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

* DOM manipulation and event handling in vanilla JavaScript
* Structuring HTML and CSS for a calculator interface
* Implementing responsive design
* Using CSS variables and consistent styling
* Debugging and fixing logical errors in JavaScript
